# Naive Bayes Algorithm {.tabset .tabset-pills}
###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## A.Create a pivot table for the training data with Online(col variable), CC (row variable), and Loan (secondary row variable).

* Imported data from Universal Bank CSV file.
* Two Predictors from the dataset : Online, CreditCard and Outcome: Personal_Loan 
* Factorized the categorical variables
* Divide the data into 60% training and 40% validation
* Created a pivot table using ftable which conveys the count with Online as a col variable, CC as a row variable, and Loan as a secondary row          variable.
```{r}

Universal_data<- read.csv("UniversalBank.csv")

#Selected 2 predictor variables(Online and CreditCard) and an outcome(Personal.Loan) variable

Universal_data <- Universal_data[,c(10,13,14)]

#Factorized the categorical variables

Universal_data$Personal.Loan<-factor(Universal_data$Personal.Loan)
Universal_data$Online <- factor(Universal_data$Online)
Universal_data$CreditCard <- factor(Universal_data$CreditCard)
str(Universal_data)

set.seed(123)

# Data Partitioning - (60% for Training data and 40% validation data)

Personal_Loan.tr.in <- createDataPartition(Universal_data$Personal.Loan,p=0.6, list=FALSE) # 60% reserved for Training
Personal_Loan.tr <-  Universal_data[Personal_Loan.tr.in,]
Personal_Loan.va <- Universal_data[-Personal_Loan.tr.in,] # Validation  data is rest

#str(Personal_Loan.tr)
#str(Personal_Loan.va)
#summary(Personal_Loan.tr)
#summary(Personal_Loan.va)

# Created a pivot table with Online as a col variable, CC as a row variable, and Loan as a secondary row variable.

ftable(Personal_Loan.tr,row.vars = c(3,1),col.vars = "Online")
```
###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## B.Looking at the pivot table,what is the probability that this customer will accept the loan offer? 
* This is the probability of loan acceptance (Loan = 1) conditional on having a bank credit card (CC = 1) and being an active user of online banking   services (Online = 1)].
* Looking at the pivot table, 
  Actual Probability p(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1) = 51/(467+51) = 0.098456 
  
  p(CC=1,Online=1|Loan=1).p(loan=1)/(p(cc=1,online=1|loan=1).p(loan=1))+(p(cc=1,online=1|loan=0).p(loan=0))               =(51/288)*(288/3000)/((51/3000)+((467/2712)*(2712/3000))) = 0.098456
```{r}
p<-((51/288)*(288/3000))/((51/3000)+((467/2712)*(2712/3000))) 
print(paste("The actual Probability of P(Loan=1| CC=1, Online=1) from pivot table: ", p))

```

###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## C.Create two separate pivot tables for the training data.
* One Pivot table will have Loan (rows) as a function of Online (columns) and the other table will have Loan (rows) as a function of CC.
* Created two pivot tables using ftables
```{r}

ftable(Personal_Loan.tr,row.vars ="Personal.Loan",col.vars = "Online")
ftable(Personal_Loan.tr,row.vars ="Personal.Loan",col.vars = "CreditCard")
```
###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## D.Compute the following quantities [P(A | B) means “the probability ofA given B”]: 

* Used ftable to create pivot tables and prop.table to calculate all the below proportions.
i.   P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) is : 0.291666666666667
ii.  P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1) is : 0.611111111111111
iii. P(Loan = 1) is : 0.096
iv.  P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) is : 0.286504424778761
v.   P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0) is : 0.594026548672566
vi.  P(Loan = 0) is : 0.904

```{r}

Loan_Online_Table <- prop.table(ftable(Personal_Loan.tr,row.vars ="Personal.Loan",col.vars = "Online"),margin = 1)
Loan_CreditCard_Table <- prop.table(ftable(Personal_Loan.tr,row.vars ="Personal.Loan",col.vars = "CreditCard"),margin = 1)
Loan_Table <- prop.table(table(Personal_Loan.tr$Personal.Loan),margin = NULL)

#i.P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors)
a<-Loan_CreditCard_Table[2,2]
print(paste("The proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) is :",a))
#ii.P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1) 
b<-Loan_Online_Table[2,2]
print(paste("The proportion of active online users among the loan acceptors P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1) is :",b))
#iii.P(Loan = 1) (the proportion of loan acceptors) 
c<-Loan_Table[2]
print(paste("The proportion of loan acceptorsP(Loan = 1) is :",c))
#iv.P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) 
d<-Loan_CreditCard_Table[1,2]
print(paste("(the proportion of credit card holders among the loan rejectors P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) is :",d))
#v.P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0)
e<-Loan_Online_Table[1,2]
print(paste("The proportion of active online users among the loan rejectors (Online = 1 | Loan = 0) is :",e))
#vi.P(Loan = 0)
f<-Loan_Table[1]
print(paste("The proportion of loan rejectors P(Loan = 0) is :",f))
```
###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## E.Use the quantities computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1).

* Using all the conditional probabilties from D to compute Naive Bayes Probability
Naive_Bayes_Prob <- P(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1) = ( (p(cc=1|Loan=1).p(Online=1|Loan=1).p(Loan=1))/(p(cc=1|Loan=1).p(Online=1|Loan=1).p(Loan=1))+(p(cc=1|Loan=0).p(Online=1|Loan=0).p(Loan=0))

```{r}

Naive_Bayes_Prob <- (Loan_CreditCard_Table[2,2]*Loan_Online_Table[2,2]*Loan_Table[2])/((Loan_CreditCard_Table[2,2]*Loan_Online_Table[2,2]*Loan_Table[2])+(Loan_CreditCard_Table[1,2]*Loan_Online_Table[1,2]*Loan_Table[1]))
Naive_Bayes_Prob

print(paste("The Naive Probability of P(Loan=1| CC=1, Online=1): ", Naive_Bayes_Prob))
```
###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## F.Compare this value with the one obtained from the pivot table in (B). Which is a more accurate estimate?
* Looking at the pivot table, The probability of that the customer will accept the loan offer from (B)
  P(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1) = 0.098455598
* The probability from naive bayes (E) :P(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1) = 0.1000861 
* There is a minimal difference between (B) and (E) which is 0.001630502 
* When it comes to comparison, (0.098 is similar to 0.100) 
* Pivot table(Actual) probability(B) is more accurate than Naive Bayes probability(E).Since pivot table does not make the assumption of the     probabilities (taking a loan if you are a cc holder and if you are an online customer) being independent. And also, there are few variables and categories to consider. So the Pivot table probability is feasible in this case.
```{r}
print(paste("Looking at the pivot table, the Probability of P(Loan=1| CC=1, Online=1): ", p))
print(paste("The Naive Probability of P(Loan=1| CC=1, Online=1): ", Naive_Bayes_Prob))
print(paste("The Minimal Difference of the both probabilities from (B) and (E): ", Naive_Bayes_Prob-p))
```


###  { .tabset .tabset-pills}
## G. Run Naive Bayes Model on the data. Compare this to the number you obtained in (E).
* Examine the model output on training data, and find the entry that corresponds to P(Loan = 1 | CC = 1, Online = 1). Compare this to the number you   obtained in (E).
* We will need Personal Loan (Which is dependent variable) and  Online, Credit card columns ( Predictor variables)
* Performed Naive Bayes model on the training data.

OBSERVATIONS FROM (E):

The Naive Bayes probability of P(Loan=1| CC=1, Online=1) from (E) is 0.1000860

OBSERVATIONS FROM THE NAIVE BAYES MODEL:

Prior Probabilities:
P(Loan=0) = 0.904
P(Loan=1) = 0.096

Conditional Probabilities:

P(CC = 1 | Loan = 0) = 0.2865044
P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) = 0.2916667
P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0) = 0.5940265
P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1) = 0.6111111

CALCULATION OF NAIVE BAYES PROBABILITY WITH THE VALUES OBTAINED FROM NAIVE BAYES MODEL :

(P(cc=1|Loan=1).P(Online=1|Loan=1).P(Loan=1))/(P(cc=1|Loan=1).P(Online=1|Loan=1).P(Loan=1)) +(P(cc=1|Loan=0).P(Online=1|Loan=0).P(Loan=0)) 

=((0.291667)*(0.611111)*(0.096))/(((0.291667)*(0.611111)*(0.096))+((0.286504)*(0.594026)*(0.904))= 0.1000864


* The Prior, conditional and the Naive Bayes Probabilities from the Naive Bayes model is similar to  (E)

```{r}
set.seed(123)

loan.nb<-naiveBayes(Personal.Loan ~ CreditCard+Online, data = Personal_Loan.tr)

loan.nb

l<-((0.291667)*(0.611111)*(0.096))/(((0.291667)*(0.611111)*(0.096))+((0.286504)*(0.594026)*(0.904)))


print(paste("the Naive Bayes Probability from the Model is :",l))


#Confusion Matrix for the training data


#Training set
set.seed(123)

pred.prob_train <- predict(loan.nb,newdata = Personal_Loan.tr,type="raw")

#Table with Personal training data and their predicted probabilities using raw arguments
predict_table_train<-cbind(Personal_Loan.tr,pred.prob_train)
head(predict_table_train)
pred.train <- predict(loan.nb,newdata = Personal_Loan.tr)
confusionMatrix(pred.train,Personal_Loan.tr$Personal.Loan)
head(pred.train)

#Validation set

pred.prob_valid <- predict(loan.nb,newdata = Personal_Loan.va,type="raw")
predict_table_valid <- cbind(Personal_Loan.va,pred.prob_valid)
head(predict_table_valid)
pred.valid <- predict(loan.nb,newdata = Personal_Loan.va)
summary(pred.valid)
confusionMatrix(pred.valid,Personal_Loan.va$Personal.Loan)



```


## Including ROC Plots

The output shows that using a cutoff of 0.901 produces the maximum value for Sensitivity (of 0.839) + Specificity (of 0.184).

```{r}
require(pROC)
# Note the delayed probabilities are in column 1
roc(Personal_Loan.va$Personal.Loan,pred.prob_valid[,1])
plot.roc(Personal_Loan.va$Personal.Loan,pred.prob_valid[,1])


plot.roc(Personal_Loan.va$Personal.Loan,pred.prob_valid[,1],print.thres="best")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
